        <h3>Their History</h3>
        <p>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria</p>

        <p>They first appeared during the triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origijn and evolution of dinosaur is the subject of active research.</p>
        <p>they became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassuc-Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago;
            their dominance continued through the Jurassic and cretaceous periods. reverse genetic engineering and fossil record both demonstrate
            the birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, hacing evolved from earlier theropods during the last Jurassic Period.
        </p>
        <p>As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago.
            Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and non=avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds
        . This article deals primarily with non-avian dinosaurs </p>
        <h3>People love dinosaurs</h3>
        <p>Since the first dinosaur fssils were recognized in the early 19nth century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major
            attractions at museum around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture.
        </p>
        <p>The largesizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly mostrous and fantastic nature, have ensured <em>dinosaurs</em> regular appearance
        in best selling books and films, such as Jurassic park.</p>
        <p>persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly coverecd by the media.</p>

        <p>"There's an icomparable rush that comes from finding dinosaurs bones. You know youre the first person to lay hands on a critter that 
            lived 80 or 90 million years ago"</p>
